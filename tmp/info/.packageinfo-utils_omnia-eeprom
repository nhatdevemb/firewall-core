Description: This package contains the omnia-eeprom utility, which allows you to display
and update EEPROM fields on the Turris Omnia router.
The EEPROM is normally not meant to be updated by users, but there are some
exceptions where it might be useful.
One such example is to change the DDR3 speed from the default 1600K mode to
1333H mode, in order to solve random crashes that occur on some boards with
newer versions of the U-Boot bootloader (because of bugs in newer versions of
the DDR training algorithm).
