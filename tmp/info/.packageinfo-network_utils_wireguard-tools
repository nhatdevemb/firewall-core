Description:   WireGuard is a novel VPN that runs inside the Linux Kernel and utilizes
  state-of-the-art cryptography. It aims to be faster, simpler, leaner, and
  more useful than IPSec, while avoiding the massive headache. It intends to
  be considerably more performant than OpenVPN.  WireGuard is designed as a
  general purpose VPN for running on embedded interfaces and super computers
  alike, fit for many different circumstances. It uses UDP.

  This package provides the userspace control program for WireGuard,
  `wg(8)`, a netifd protocol helper, and a re-resolve watchdog script.
